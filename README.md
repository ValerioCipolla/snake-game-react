# React Snake Game

Right after learning React on the SchoolOfCode Bootcamp, I felt like I needed more practice, to really understand how this great library works. I could see its potential, but I didn't really grasped how it worked yet. That is why I decided to embark on a little solo project, to work on during evenings and week-ends: build the famous Snake Game - we all played it on our phones at least once in our life - and I was gonna do it using only React (and a little CSS to make it look better :D). I did NOT follow a tutorial, and I stopped myself from googling 'how to build a snake game with react' - I wanted to struggle, because I strongly believe that is what I needed to become a better software engineer. It's fair to say it was a battle, I had to figure out how to represent a snake on the screen, how to make it move and how to make it change direction. I ended up using an array of squares to create the snake, various timeouts to make it move at regular intervals and event listeners to tell the snake when and how to change directions. I can honestly say 90% of the things I know about React, I learnt them through this project, I had to work out where various states needed to live, when it was necessary to lift state up, how to use useEffect and how to clean up after myself when setting up timeouts and event listeners, how useReducer exactly works and many more things. I really do suggest you try it out by clicking the LIVE SITE button above - it's FUN! Looking at the future: I want to create the back-end for this project, to make it possible for people to enter their score once they finish playing and display a leaderboard to see what the best score is. I also want to create a tutorial where I explain HOW I built the game so other people can learn it with me.
